<h2> CS 455 Lab 7: Java LinkedList class</h2>
</center>

<hr>
<h3> Goals and Background </h3>

This lab consists of some problems for you to practice programming
with the Java LinkedList class.  You will probably have to refer to
the Java API documentation for LinkedList and ListIterator to complete
the problems.  We have provided links directly to those pages below.
<p>

<h3> Advanced preparation </h3>

There is more code to write in this lab than most, so you may want to
spend some time before the lab preparing handwritten solutions to the
problems, especially the last problem.
<p>

<h3>Reading and reference material</h3> 
<ul> 
<li> <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/LinkedList.html">Java API <kbd>LinkedList</kbd> documentation</a>

<li> <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/ListIterator.html">Java API <kbd>ListIterator</kbd> documentation</a>
<li> Horstmann, Section 15.1 Using Linked Lists
<li> 2/23 lecture on Java LinkedList class</a> (<a href="http://scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/lectures/notes/listClass.pdf">slides</a> -- link will work by 2/23)


</ul>

<H3>Exercise 1 (1 checkoff point)</H3>

Write a static method <kbd>printAlt</kbd> that prints every other element in a
list, starting with the first one.  For example


<pre>
<strong>list</strong>          <strong>printAlt(list) output</strong>
2 4 7           2 7
2 4             2
2 4 7 9 3 2     2 7 3
2 4 7 9 3       2 7 3
</pre>

We have provided a test driver for your method that tests it on
several hard-coded cases.  The test driver source file, <a
href="PrintAltTester.java"><kbd>PrintAltTester.java</kbd></a>,
contains the stub for the <kbd>printAlt</kbd> method.
<p>

<H3>Exercise 2 (1 checkoff point)</H3>

Write a static method <kbd>after7</kbd> that removes all the values
after the last 7 in a list.  Note: this problem is adapted from an
array problem on the codingbat.com website.  Here are some examples

<pre>
<strong>list</strong>          <strong>list after call to after7(list)</strong>
2 4 7                  2 4 7
2 4                    2 4
2 4 7 9 3 2            2 4 7
2 4 7 9 7 3 7 1 2      2 4 7 9 7 3 7
7 5 4                  7
</pre>

We have provided a test driver for your method that tests it on
several hard-coded cases, and compares the actual results with the expected results.  The test driver source file, <a
href="After7Tester.java"><kbd>After7Tester.java</kbd></a>,
contains the stub for the <kbd>after7</kbd> method.
<p>
Hint: you can initialize an iterator positioned at the end of the list (i.e., after the last element) as follows:

<pre>
ListIterator&lt;Integer&gt; iter = list.listIterator(list.size());
</pre>


<H3>Exercise 3 (1 checkoff point)</H3>

Write a static method <kbd>hasPeak</kbd> that returns true if its list
argument has a single peak, and false otherwise.  This means that the
sequence of values consists wholly of an increasing part followed by a
decreasing part. You may assume no two consecutive values in the array
are the same (i.e., no flat areas).

<pre>
<strong>list</strong>               <strong>hasPeak(list)</strong>
2 4 7              false
2 7 4              true
7 4 2              false
2 4                false
2                  false
2 4 7 9 3 2        true
2 4 7 9 7 3 7 1    false
7 5 4              false
2 4 2 3            false 
5 4 3              false 
</pre>

We have provided a test driver for your method that tests it on
several hard-coded cases, and compares the actual results with the expected results.  The test driver source file, <a
href="PeakTester.java"><kbd>PeakTester.java</kbd></a>,
contains the stub for the <kbd>hasPeak</kbd> method.
