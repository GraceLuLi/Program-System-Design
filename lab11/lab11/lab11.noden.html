<h2> CS 455 Lab 11: C++ Debugger / Linked lists</h2>
</center>

Spring 2012 [Bono]<BR>
</p>

<hr>
<h3> Goals and Background </h3>

This lab will give you some practice with linked lists, along the way
introducing you to a symbolic debugger to use with g++-compiled
programs on Unix.
<p>
The linked list aspect of the lab is to give you practice with
reasoning about and writing linked list code, by dealing with some
buggy linked list code.  One focus of this lab is not debugging per
se, but being able to predict a program's behavior from looking at the
code; this will help you write correct code.
<p>
The lab instructions assume you will be
using the <kbd>gdb</kbd> debugger which can run inside of emacs.  You
may want to print out the help-sheet called "Debugging in Unix" that's
linked below, under <a href="#reading">Reading and Reference
Material</a> for easy reference while doing the lab.  There is also a
graphical oriented <kbd>ddd</kbd> debugger described in that debugging
handout: it's very slow to start up (which may be exacerbated if you
all do it at the same time during the lab), and has a few other
glitches; we don't recommend you use it for the purposes of this lab.

<H3>Exercise 0</H3>

(I meant to put this in your first C++ lab, but forgot.)
<p>
This part is just to make sure your environment is set up correctly.

<p>

<strong><kbd>g++</kbd> version.</strong>
<br>
Make sure your account is set up to run the most recent version of
g++.  Do the Unix command

<pre>
g++ --version
</pre>

which should say version 4.2.1 or higher.  If yours shows that
version, go on to <a href="#gdb">gdb version</a>.
  (99% of you should already have the right version.)
<p>
If it has an older version, e.g., 2.95.2, some of the source and
object code we will be using this semester may not work for you.  You would
probably only have this older version if you had set it up explicitly
for another course (e.g., I believe CS 402 is using this version).
<p>
<strong>How to set it to the right version.</strong> The newer version
is the default version in Unix, so you'll just need to get rid of the
stuff that is making your account use the old version instead.
Comment out any lines in your <kbd>.cshrc</kbd> and <kbd>.login</kbd>
files that reference the old version.  You can comment out lines in a
shell script such as the aforementioned "dot" files by putting a # at
the beginning of the line.  For example, you may have a line that
looks something like the following:

<pre>
source /usr/usc/gnu/2.95.2/setup.csh
</pre>

You may also have other lines in these files that reference 2.95.2,
for example, ones setting something like LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  Comment out
those lines too (i.e., if they have a 2.95.2 path in the command).
<p>
<a name="gdb"><strong><kbd>gdb</kbd> version</strong></a>

<br>

Last semester some students that were concurrently taking EE 457 or had taken
it in the past had a different version of gdb set to be the default
in their account.  Run the command:

<pre>
which gdb
</pre>

If the output of <kbd>which</kbd> is <kbd>/usr/usc/bin/gdb</kbd> you
are all set and can go on to Exercise 1.  If not, you can take the
other version of gdb out of your path, if you don't currently need it
for another class.  The TA can help you do this.  Or, you can type in
the whole pathname every time you want to run gdb to help you debug
your C++ programs (that's sort of a pain to remember, though).  And
with the second option you won't be able to run it from inside emacs.

<p>
Once you make the fix, you will need to log out and log in again for
the change to take effect.
<p>
If you need any help making these changes ask the TA, or see Claire in
office hours.  If for some reason you need to use both versions of the
g++ compiler this semester, see Claire for help.

<H3>Exercise 1 (1 checkoff point)</H3>
<p>
Copy the files for the lab to your account by typing:

<pre> cp -r ~csci455/labs/lab11 lab11 </pre>

<p>

Load the source code file <KBD>factors.cpp</KBD> into emacs.
<p>
<KBD>factors.cpp</KBD> is a program for calculating all of the factors
of a number.  The program does not quite work as is.  Since you've
seen it before, it will be easy to debug it: the goal here is to use
<kbd>gdb</kbd>.
<p>
Compile and run the <kbd>factors.cpp</kbd> program.  To make this
easier for you, we've created a Makefile for you with rules for
compiling all the code for this lab.  To compile factors inside emacs,
type esc-x compile (like we did for Java programs), then give the
command

<pre>
gmake factors
</pre>

This makes an executable called <kbd>factors</kbd>
<p>
Use <kbd>gdb</kbd> to find out where the program crashed.  See the
<a
href="../../doc/debug.html">debugging handout
</a>
 for how to start up <kbd>gdb</kbd> from inside emacs, and for how to
use it in this kind of situation.  Note: when running gdb from emacs,
it will show the current line being executed by a little arrow to the
left of that line in a separate source code buffer.  Use
<kbd>gdb</kbd> and program examination to find the cause of the error,
and fix it.  The mistake causing the run-time error can be corrected by
changing only <EM>one</EM> line.
<p>
Note: when the program crashes it may say "core dumped"; this means a
large file, called <kbd>core</kbd> containing the contents of memory
at the time of the crash is now in your directory.  In dire
circumstances you could examine this file to help you debug, but we
will not need it here, so delete it.
<p>
Recompile your new version and run it.  (Hint: You can abort a program
by typing <KBD>ctrl-c</KBD>, or if you're running in an emacs shell
window, <KBD>ctrl-c ctrl-c</KBD>.)  Use <kbd>gdb</kbd> again to help
find the remaining error: You can abort the program from inside
<kbd>gdb</kbd> to see where it is executing, then you can look at the
values of variables.  See the debugging handout for more details.
<p>
For check-off show the TA your working working <kbd>factors</kbd>
program running in <kbd>gdb</kbd> under emacs.  In particular show him how you
set a breakpoint, run to the breakpoint, and then single step through
the program for a few iterations, displaying the values of key
variables.

<H3>Exercise 2 (1 checkoff point)</H3>

Note: the beginning of this and the next exercise involves your
stepping away from the computer and using pencil and
paper.  The best approach is probably for you and your partner to each
draw the diagram independently, and then get together to reconcile the
results.

<PRE>
// BUGGY sumList
// PRE: list is a well-formed list
// POST: returns sum of elements in list
int sumList (Node *list)
{
  Node *p = list;
  int sum = 0;

  while (p!=NULL) {
    sum += p->data;
    p->next = p;
  }
  return sum;
}
</PRE>
<p>
Draw a box-and-pointer diagram showing the state of <KBD>sumList</KBD> on
entry with a non-empty list, and after each of several iterations of
the loop.
<p>
The <kbd>testlist</kbd> program is a small interactive program to test
several linked list routines, including <kbd>sumList</kbd>.  You can
compile it using <kbd>gmake testlist</kbd>.  Note: don't be surprised
that the "b"uild function of <kbd>testlist</kbd> builds the list in
reverse order from the order the values are entered.
<p>
Compile and run the <kbd>testlist</kbd> program to test
<KBD>sumList</KBD> and verify your appraisal of what it currently
does.  Use <KBD>gdb</KBD> to verify your
box-and-pointer diagram for the buggy <KBD>sumList</KBD> function.
HINT: if you <KBD>print</KBD> a pointer in <KBD>gdb</KBD> you get it's
value, which is an address (in hex).  To see what a pointer,
<KBD>p</KBD>, points to, you can <KBD>print *p</KBD>.  If two pointers
point to the same object, you will know this because they will have
the same address.
<p>
For checkoff show the t.a. your diagram, describe what happened in
<KBD>gdb</KBD>, and show him what the fix was.
<p>
<H3>Exercise 3 (1 checkoff point)</H3>
<p>
<PRE>
// BUGGY append routine
// PRE: list is a well-formed list
// POST: list' is same as list, but with item appended
void append (Node * &list, int item)
{
  Node *p = list;

  if (p == NULL) {
    insertFront(list, item);
    return;
  }

  while (p->next != NULL) {
    p = p->next;
  }

  p = new Node(item);

}
</PRE>
<p>
On paper create a box-and-pointer diagram for <KBD>append</KBD> of an empty list,
and append of a non-empty list.
<p>
Compile and run the program to test <KBD>append</KBD> and verify your
appraisal of what it currently does.  Use <KBD>gdb</KBD> if necessary to get
further information.
<p>
Fix the problem, and create a box-and-pointer diagram for the
corrected version showing the values of the variables at the end of
the function.
<p>
For checkoff, show the TA your two diagrams, and the corrected version
of the program.

<H3>Exercise 4 (1 checkoff point)</H3>
<p>
Complete the implementation of the function <KBD>printEveryOther</KBD>
(skeleton of body and call already appear in <KBD>testlist.cpp</KBD>).
<p>
Your implementation must only do about <EM>n/2</EM> iterations of the
loop, where <EM>n</EM> is the length of the list.  Your code must work
for both even- and odd-length lists.  Here's the skeleton:
<p>
<PRE>
// printEveryOther: prints 1st, 3rd, 5th, ... elements in a list
// PRE: list is a well-formed linked list
void printEveryOther(Node * list)
{
  while (list != NULL) {
    cout << list->data << " ";

    // YOU COMPLETE THE BODY OF THE LOOP
  }
  cout << endl;
}
</PRE>
