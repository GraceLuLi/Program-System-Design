1.Because the program takes each step by random, so it could  go back, which 
form the dead ends.

2. When iconify window,the path changes.The reason is that the grahic is redrawn, it takes another random path.

3.A possible solution is that set a variable to keep the component, such that 
each time redrawn the windom, the graphics output keep same, only after another command of 'java RandomWalkViewer', it changes.
