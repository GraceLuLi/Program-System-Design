<a name="intro"><h3>Introduction</h3></a>

In this assignment you will get practice using the Java
<kbd>LinkedList</kbd> class, and practice using the Java exception
mechanism.  The assignment involves enhancements to your last
assignment.  There are three main types of enhancement: (1) you'll
reimplement your Poly class to use a LinkedList instead of an
ArrayList, (2) you'll add some new functionality (methods) to the Poly
class (one of which would be less efficient if we had used an
ArrayList); and (3) you'll make your PolyProg more bullet-proof.  Item
(2) will also involve changes to your PolyProg so users can use the
new operations available on Poly objects.
<p>
Because this links back to your PA2 assignment description in several
places and has many section names that are the same, to help you not
get confused about which document you are viewing, we preceded many of
these common section names with the string (PA3) in this document and
changed the background color of this assignment.

<a name="files"><h3>The assignment files</h3> 
</a>

<strong>Getting the assignment files.</strong> 
Make a pa3 directory and copy all of the source code files from
<kbd>~csci455/assgts/pa3</kbd> to that directory (i.e., all the .java files).

<p>

The files in <strong><tt>bold</tt></strong></a> below are ones you
 create and/or modify and submit.  The ones not in bold are ones that
 you will use, but not modify.  The files are:

<ul>

<li><a href="Poly.java"><strong><kbd>Poly.java</kbd></strong></a> The
<a href="#interface">interface</a> for the <kbd>Poly</kbd> class; it
contains stub versions of the functions so it will compile.  You will
be completing the <a href="#impl">implementation</a> of this class.
You may not change the interface to the existing methods for this
class, but you may add private instance variables and/or private
methods to it.  You may also add public methods to be used for
debugging/development purposes only, such as <kbd>toString</kbd> (more
about that in Section 10.7.1 of the textbook) or one to create a
hard-code poly (more <a href="#devel">here</a>).

<li><a href="Term.java"><kbd>Term.java</kbd></a> Code for a class for
a single term in a polynomial.  Same exact code as for PA2.
p
<li><strong><kbd>PolyTester.java</kbd></strong> A non-interactive test
program for your <kbd>Poly</kbd> class.  You will want to add new
tests to it in addition to what you had for PA2.  You are not required
to submit this file.

<li><strong><kbd>PolyProg.java</kbd></strong> The command-based
program that lets you manipulate polynomials.  It has all of the
commands of the old version, plus some new ones, and some new 
<a href="#error">error handling</a>.
Its behavior is specified <a href="#prog">later</a> in the
assignment.  You probably will want to use <em>a copy of</em> the one
you submitted for PA2 as a starting point for your code.

<li><strong><kbd>README</kbd></strong> See
section on <a href="#submit">Submitting your program</a> for what to
put in it.  You create this file.

</ul>

<a name="run"><h3>Note on running your program</h3>

As with PA2, we will be using <kbd>assert</kbd> statements in this
program.  To be able to use them, you need to run the program with
asserts enabled (-ea flag).  (You do not need to compile any special
way.)  Here are two examples:

<pre>
java -ea PolyTester
java -ea PolyProg
</pre>

You should run with this flag set every time.
<p>

<a name="assgt"><h3>The assignment</h3>
</a>

The overview of the changes to PA2 for this assignment were already given
in the <a href="#intro">introduction</a>.  The detailed explanation of
those changes, as well as a few other more minor ones, are described
in detail in the following sections of the document, and then
summarized <a href="#summary">near the end</a> of the document.
<p>

<a name="interface"><h3>(PA3) Poly: interface</h3>

We have repeated the part of the interface you implemented for PA2
here for your convenience.  The methods new to PA3 are shown with a *
next to them.
<p>

<dl>

<dt>
<kbd><strong>Poly p = new Poly();</kbd></strong>
<dd>
Create the zero polynomial.  That is one all of whose coefficients have
the value zero.
<p>

<dt>
<kbd><strong>Poly p = new Poly(new Term(3,5));</kbd></strong>
<dd>
Create a polynomial with a single term.  For example, the above
expression creates the polynomial <kbd>3x<sup>5</sup></kbd>.
<p>


<dt>
<kbd><strong>* Poly poly2 = new Poly(poly1);</kbd></strong>
<dd>

Makes a copy of a polynomial.  The statement above makes poly2 refer
to the copy of poly1.  Such a constructor is called a copy
constructor, and we'll refer to it as such in this document.  After
calling the copy constructor, changes to poly1 do not affect poly2 and
vice versa.


<pre>
poly1: 3x<sup>3</sup> + 2x + 7
poly2: 3x<sup>3</sup> + 2x + 7
</pre>
<p>


<dt>
<kbd><strong>Poly sum = poly1.add(poly2);</kbd></strong>
<dd>
Add two polynomials, resulting in a new one that is the sum of the first two.
The two original polynomials are unchanged.
<pre>
poly1: 3x<sup>3</sup> + 2x + 7
poly2: x<sup>5</sup> -3x<sup>3</sup> + 5
sum:   x<sup>5</sup> + 2x + 12
</pre>
<p>

<dt>
<kbd><strong>double result = poly1.eval(x);</kbd></strong>
<dd>
Evaluate a polynomial for a specific floating point value of x.
<pre>
poly1: 3x<sup>3</sup> + 2x + 7
x: 2
result: 35
</pre>
<p>

<dt>
<kbd><strong>System.out.println(poly1.toFormattedString());</kbd></strong>

<dd> Return a String version of the polynomial that's close to the
usual format we use to denote polynomials.  It's "close to", because
it's not going to use a superscript to denote exponentiation.  Here's
the format to use: <pre>3x^2 + 2x + 7.0</pre>

For the zero polynomial print <kbd>0.0</kbd>.

Note that to make the coding easier a <kbd>double</kbd> that has no
decimal part is printed as, for example, "3.0" instead of "3"; that's
the default format used in Java when converting such a <kbd>double</kbd> to
a <kbd>String</kbd>.  
<p>

<dt>
<kbd><strong>* poly1.addIn(poly2);</kbd></strong>
<dd>
Add a polynomial to an existing polynomial.  poly2 is unchanged.
This is the only Poly mutator: the implicit parameter changes as a 
result of this operation.

<pre>
poly1 before: 3x<sup>3</sup> + 2x + 7
poly2: x<sup>5</sup> -3x<sup>3</sup> + 5
poly1 after:   x<sup>5</sup> + 2x + 12
</pre>
<p>


<dt>
<kbd><strong>* Poly product = poly1.mult(poly2);</kbd></strong>
<dd>

Multiply two polynomials, resulting in a new one that is the product of
the first two.  The two original polynomials are unchanged.

<pre>
poly1: 3x<sup>3</sup> + 2.0x + 7
poly2: x<sup>5</sup> - 3x<sup>3</sup> + 5
product: 3x<sup>8</sup> - 7x<sup>6</sup> + 7x<sup>5</sup> - 6x<sup>4</sup> - 6x<sup>3</sup> + 10x + 35
</pre>
<p>


</dl>

As before, no <kbd>Poly</kbd> functions should do any I/O.
<p>

<a name="impl"><h3>(PA3) Poly: representation/implementation</h3>

We are using the same basic sparse representation as we did in PA2, it
will just be in a LinkedList here instead of an ArrayList.  So, like
before we are only explicitly representing non-zero terms, and keeping
them in decreasing order by exponent.  Please see <a
href="../pa2/pa2.html#impl">PA2</a> for more information about the
sparse representation.

<p>


<a name="add"><h4>(PA3) More on adding two polynomials</h4>

In PA3 we have <em>two</em> different functions for adding two
polynomials.  You could maintain two versions of code for adding
two polynomials, but a better option is to write the <kbd>addIn</kbd>
(+=) method first (which now operates on LinkedLists), and then
implement <kbd>add</kbd> in terms of the copy constructor and
<kbd>addIn</kbd>.  Hint: the <kbd>add</kbd> method will
be very short.
<p>
Your <kbd>addIn</kbd> function is required to take O(<em>m</em> +
<em>n</em>), where <em>m</em> is the length of the first poly, and
<em>n</em> is the length of the second poly, just like <kbd>add</kbd>
in PA2.  It will use the same merge algorithm as before, but the code
won't be exactly the same as before, because it will be modifying the
list in the first poly, rather than creating a new poly from scratch.
<p>
<kbd>add</kbd> is still required to also be O(m + n), which will be
true if you implement it in terms of the O(m + n) <kbd>addIn</kbd>.
<p>
Please take special care to make sure that the case <kbd>a.addIn(a)</kbd>
works correctly (and definitely test that case).
<p>
For more information on merging two ordered lists please see <a
href="../pa2/pa2.html#add">the corresponding section in PA2</a>.
<p>
<a name="add2"><h4>Additional requirement on adding two polynomials</h4>

New to PA3, you must optimize the case where the right operand (i.e.,
explicit parameter) of the <kbd>addin</kbd> has
exponents that are all smaller than the smallest one in the left
operand (i.e., the implicit parameter).  For ease in discussing it further,
assume the following call:

<pre>
p1.addIn(p2);
</pre>

The optimization is that this case has to run in O(<em>n</em>)
(<em>n</em> is size of p2), rather than O(<em>m</em> + <em>n</em>).  This
implies you cannot traverse <kbd>p1</kbd> for that case.  There are
LinkedList operations to support this.  In particular you can access
the last element in a linked list in constant time (unfortunately the
Java LinkedList documentation is not very clear on the time complexity of
its various methods).
<p>
Why is this optimization useful?  There are two situations here where
it comes up:

<ol>

<li> Consider the PolyProg <kbd>create</kbd> operation.  Suppose the
list of terms a user gives for creating a polynomial is already in
decreasing order by exponent (which is somewhat likely).  E.g., Their
data for the create command is as follows.

<pre>
3 4 100 2 25 0
</pre>

Note: You will only be able to take advantage of this optimization in
your program if you also change the implementation of the PolyProg
create command to use <kbd>addIn</kbd> instead of add.  (<kbd>add</kbd> always involves copying the first list, an O(m) operation.)

<p>
<li> If you want to use <kbd>addIn</kbd> to help you implement <kbd>mult</kbd>
(more on that in the next sub-section), there are some cases where the
second operand will have one or more terms, all of which are smaller
than the first operand.  This will save you from a bunch of
unnecessary traversals in those cases.

</ol>

<strong>Question 1:</strong> Suppose a PolyProg user does the
<kbd>create</kbd> command to create a polynomial with <em>n</em>
terms, such that he/she enters them in decreasing order by exponent (a
small, <em>n</em>=3, example of this was shown in item 1 above).  In
big-O terms, how long will it take to create the <em>n</em>-term
polynomial, using your optimized version of <kbd>addIn</kbd>?  <p>

<strong>Question 2:</strong> Same question, but assuming the
user didn't enter the terms in any particular order?
<p>
Put the answers to these questions in your README file.

<a name="mult"><h4>More on multiplying polynomials</h4>

Your mult routine is definitely allowed to be O(<em>m</em> *
<em>n</em>), since that's how many terms need to be multiplied
together pairwise.  It will probably be easier to write the code if
your <kbd>mult</kbd> method uses <kbd>add</kbd> or <kbd>addIn</kbd>.

<a name="copy"><h4>More on copy constructor for polynomials</h4>

We didn't need a copy constructor for PA2, because the Poly class
there was immutable, which is no longer the case for PA3.
Normally a copy constructor would do a "deep" copy, such that all
sub-parts, and sub-parts of sub-parts also get copied.  However,
since <kbd>Term</kbd>s are immutable, they do not need to be copied by
your copy constructor.  Hint: this method will be <em>very</em> short.

<a name="invar"><h3>(PA3) Implementation invariants and isValidPoly</h3>

The <kbd>isValidPoly</kbd> method and its use in <kbd>assert</kbd>
statements is still required in PA3, as well as an implementation
invariant comment (the latter is part of our published style
guidelines).
<p>
Since your representation is very similar to last time, your
implementation invariant won't be very different, and your
<kbd>isValidPoly</kbd> method will be checking the same basic things,
although the code is not identical, since we're using a different data
structure.
<p>
New to PA3 the Poly class has a mutator, <kbd>addIn</kbd>, so you'll
need to call <kbd>isValidPoly</kbd> in an assert statement on the
implicit parameter at the end of that method too, as well as for the
Poly objects created by the copy constructor and <kbd>mult</kbd> in those
methods.
<p>


<a name="test"><h3>(PA3) PolyTester program</h3>

<p>

You should be able to reuse your PolyTester code from PA2, although
you'll need to add tests of the new Poly methods we're adding for this
assignment.
<p>

Besides the usual stuff, some particular test cases you'll want to
make sure to include: ones that use the optimized part of
<kbd>add</kbd> / <kbd>addIn</kbd>, ones that check that your copy
constructor actually makes a copy of the object (i.e., changing one
copy doesn't have an effect on the other), and tests of adding a poly
to itself (using addIn).

<p>

<a name="prog"><h3>(PA3) Poly program</h3>

Like in the last assignment, we're going to show you the user
interface by example.  To keep the example shorter, it just
demonstrates the new commands: <kbd>addin</kbd>, <kbd>mult</kbd>, and
<kbd>copy</kbd>, corresponding to the three new Poly methods.  For
more complete information about the startup actions of the program,
and the arguments and output for the commands carried over from PA2,
you should look at <a href="../pa2/pa2.html#prog">that programming
assignment</a>: their interface hasn't changed for correct cases,
although they may result in different output in PA3 when they are
given invalid input by the user, because of our more robust error
processing (to be described further soon).
<p>
Like the similar example in PA2, this one shows a few of the input
error conditions and associated error messages, but not all of them.
See the next <a href="#error">section</a> for details of error
checking.
<p>
Again, your error messages, beginning message, and help output do not
have to match the output here character-by-character, although all the
other output must match what you see here.
<p>

cmd&gt; <strong>PriNt 4</strong>         <em>(commands can be upper or lower case)</em>
x^2 + -9
cmd&gt; <strong>quit</strong>
</pre>
<p>

<a name="error"><h3>(PA3) Error checking required</h3>

As mentioned earlier, you're going to make your program bullet-proof,
i.e., your program will handle any invalid input given by the user.
<p>
Here is a list of errors your poly program must check for:  

<ul>
<li> invalid command

<li> For the arguments to the commands (i.e., polynomial id numbers)

<ul>

<li> illegal polynomial index

<li> wrong type of input (e.g., "3.4" or "foo")

<li> too few arguments

<li> too many arguments

</ul>

<li> for the polynomial data for the <kbd>create</kbd> command:

<ul>
  <li> wrong type of input (doubles are supposed to alternate with
  int.  The following input sequence <em>is</em> valid: "3 4")

  <li> negative exponent

  <li>missing the last exponent (i.e., odd number of values).
  For this you should ignore the last value entered (i.e., the term that
  had a coefficient given with no corresponding exponent).

  </ul> 
</ul>

Like before, all error messages should start with the string "ERROR:"
(with one exception we'll describe soon).  Then you should provide an
informative message, which either would briefly describe what correct
input was expected, or refer the user to the help option (and the help
option would explain what was expected).
<p>
For all of the errors related to the command line (i.e., in response
to <kbd>"cmd>"</kbd> prompt), once you report the error (as described
above), you ignore the command, and return to the command prompt.
There is an example of this shown in the previous section.
<p>
For all of the errors related to the polynomial data entered for the
<kbd>create</kbd> command, except for the last one mentioned, once you
report the error, you ignore the data entered, and return to the
prompt for entering polynomial data (i.e., "Enter a
space-separated...").  Your error messages here should not refer
the user to the help option, since they wouldn't be able to use it at
that point.  There is an example of this shown in the previous section.
<p>
The last error mentioned above, missing the last exponent, is a
special case.  Because you are recovering from the bad input, in that
case you do actually carry out the command, so you don't prompt
for a new list of terms.  For this one only print WARNING instead
of ERROR, and briefly describe the corrective action being taken.

<a name="exceptions"><h3>(PA3) Error processing and exceptions</h3>

The exception mechanism will be helpful for doing the error processing
required for this assignment.  In particular the following tips may be helpful:

<ul>
<li> familiarize yourself with the exceptions that the
<kbd>Scanner</kbd> methods can throw.  There's a link to Scanner
documentation in the <a href="#resources">resources</a> section near
the beginning of this document.
<p>

<li> you may or may not have done this for pa2, but to process errors
related to wrong numbers of arguments for the commands, you will need
to assume all the arguments will be entered on the same line; i.e., use
the newline as a delimiter for the command plus its arguments.  You saw
how to process values in a single line in lab 5 and pa2.
<p>

<li> also, especially since our error processing is now more
sophisticated, and to avoid repeated code for processing command line
arguments, you may want to have a special method to process and
return command-line arguments.  It would return the list of arguments
each in <kbd>int</kbd> form if the arguments are all <a
href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hunky-dory">hunky-dory</a>,
or throw an exception if they aren't.  E.g., it might have a header
such as the following (some details left out):

<pre>
private static int[] getCommandArgs(..., int numArgs) throws ...
</pre>
<p>

<li> then you can catch the exception(s) thrown above several levels
away from where the error was detected.  E.g., in your <kbd>main</kbd>
that has the main loop for the program.
<p>

<li> likewise for processing the the polynomial data for the create command:
If you don't have one already, you probably want to add a static
method for parsing that data (similar to getCommandArgs, described
above).  It won't be convenient to return an array since we don't know
ahead of time how many arguments there will be, but it could return an
ArrayList&lt;Term&gt; or the Poly itself.  (The first one means an ArrayList
of the terms the user entered, which is distinct from what would be in a
Poly created from this data.)
<p>

<li> it may be useful to create your own exception type.  Furthermore,
you may want to turn Scanner exceptions into that new type to have
uniform error message reporting format for most or all of your exceptions.  To
turn one exception into another: in a <kbd>catch</kbd> for one
exception, you just <kbd>throw</kbd> a different exception.  There is
an example of code to create your own exception type in the case study
developed in section 11.8 of the text.
<p>


</ul>

We recommend you implement and test the error processing required for
this assignment separately from testing the new features of the
<kbd>Poly</kbd> class.  More about this in the <a
href="#devel">Program development hints</a> section.


<a name="lineinput"><h3>Reading polynomial data for <kbd>create</kbd>
command</h3>

This part has not changed, except for the error processing mentioned
<a href="#error">above</a>.  For more information about it, see the <a
href="../pa2/pa2.html#lineinput">corresponding section</a> in the PA2
assignment.
<p>

<a name="devel"><h3>(PA3) Program development hints</h3>

As usual, we recommend using incremental development.  The
<kbd>Poly</kbd> class implementation and the error processing required
in <kbd>PolyProg</kbd> are somewhat independent, so you could develop
either of these before doing the other.
<p>
In particular, you could add all of the error-checking features to
your PA2 version of <kbd>PolyProg</kbd> and test them, before you even
start with the changes to Poly, or the new PolyProg commands.  This
might involve some restructuring (so-called refactoring) of the code
and methods of PolyProg to avoid repeating code unnecessarily.  Once
that was done, you could then redo and test Poly with an updated
PolyTester, and finally, add the new commands to PolyProg.
<p>
Or, alternatively, you could modify the implementation of your Poly
class first, adding the new methods too, and then test them completely with
a modified PolyTester program, and with your PolyProg from PA2.  The
PolyProg from PA2 and your old PolyTester tests make up a form of a
regression test on the Poly class.  I.e., you want the output for your
new Poly class to give the exact same output as your old Poly class
did on the PA2 tests (i.e., assuming your old Poly class worked
correctly).
<p>

Another option is to just reimplement the PA2 poly as a
LinkedList first, before adding any other functionality; this is not a
bad idea, making it very easy to do regressing tests with your two PA2
test programs.  However, it would involve later (in refactoring) throwing away some
of the code you wrote: the recommended way to implement <kbd>add</kbd>
and <kbd>addIn</kbd> to get the most code-reuse (i.e., have less code
to implement) involved writing the <kbd>add</kbd> method that calls
<kbd>addIn</kbd>
(see <a href="#add">here</a> for more information).

<p>

Like in PA2, within the implementation of the Poly class, you can play
tricks to aid with incremental development there.  
Suppose you'd like to try writing code to iterate through a list,
(e.g., by writing toFormattedString), before doing fancier stuff such
as merging two lists (like in <kbd>addIn</kbd>).  Here are some suggestions:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
One way to achieve this would be to add a public method to load in a
bunch of hard-coded data into a Poly, similar to the
<kbd>loadNames</kbd> method that was in the <a
href="http://www-scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/lectures/code/02-07/complete/Names.java"><kbd>Names</kbd>
class</a> we discussed in lecture a while ago.
<p>

<li>
Another way to do it would be to write an initial version of <kbd>addIn</kbd>
 that only works correctly if the largest exponent of the second Poly
 is smaller than all the ones in the first poly.  Then you test this
 temporary version of <kbd>addIn</kbd> on cases where that is true, so you
 can build a Poly easily on which to try out toFormattedString.  E.g.

<pre>
Poly p = new Poly();
for (int exp = 5; exp >= 0; exp-=1) {
   p.addIn(new Term(exp+1, exp));
}
System.out.println(p.toFormattedString());
</pre>

The above test is just one example, by itself it doesn't test all the
features of toFormattedString.
<p>
</ul>  

<a name="summary"><h3>(PA3) Summary of requirements</h3>

As on the first assignment, there are several requirements for this
assignment related to design, testing, and development process strewn
throughout this document.  We'll summarize those and the functional
requirements here:

<ul>

<li> implement Poly class according it's public interface.  In
addition to the methods from PA2, this now includes three new methods,
<kbd>addIn</kbd>, the copy constructor, and <kbd>mult</kbd> (see <a
href="#interface">Poly: interface</a>)

<li> use the LinkedList representation for Poly described in the
<a href="#impl">section</a> about that.

<li> the <kbd>Poly add</kbd> and <kbd>addIn</kbd> methods can't run in
more than O(m+n) time as described in the section on <a
href="#add">adding two polynomials</a>.  (Same requirement as on PA2.)

<li> the two Poly add functions must run in O(n) time for the special case
described in <a href="#add2">this section</a>.

<li> implement and use private Poly method <kbd>isValidPoly</kbd> as described 
in PA2 <a href="../pa2/pa2.html#valid">here</a>.  (Same requirement as on PA2.)

<li> augment your PolyProg from PA2 so that it now supports some
additional commands corresponding to the new Poly methods, and has
improved error processing.  More about the user interface in the
section on the <a href="#prog">Poly program</a>.

<li> make the PolyProg interface bullet-proof.  More about this in the
section on <a href="#error">error checking</a>.

<li> this program will also be evaluated on style and documentation.
The style guidelines for the course are linked from the Programming
Assignments page for CS 455, and <a href="../style.html">here</a>.

<li> create a README file, as described below.
</ul>


<a name="submit"><h3>(PA3) README file / Submitting your program</h3>

You will be submitting <kbd>Poly.java</kbd>,
<kbd>PolyProg.java</kbd>, and
<kbd>README</kbd>.  Optionally, you will also be submitting one or
more files for any additional classes you created.  For example, if
you added your own exception class, as described <a
href="#exceptions">here</a>.  If you do add your own classes in separate
files, please document that in the README, and make sure you add them
as arguments to the submit command you use (more about that below).
Make sure your name and loginid appear at the
start of each file.
<p>
Here's a review of what goes in the README:  This is the place to
document known bugs in your program. That means you should describe
thoroughly any test cases that fail for the the program you are
submitting.  You can also use the README to give the grader any other
special information, such as if there is some special way to compile
or run your program.  In addition don't forget put in your answer to 
the README questions given in <a href="#add2">this section</a>.
<p>
Like last time, for your convenience we put the exact submit command
to use in a shell script.
Type:

<pre>
~csci455/assgts/pa3/turninpa3
</pre>

to submit the program.  (It's just a text file, so you can look at
its <a href="turninpa3">contents</a> to see the submit command it will run.)
<p>

If you have additional files to submit (e.g., if you added your own
exception class), you'll need to edit a local copy of the
<kbd>turninpa3</kbd> file.  Using the following command to copy it
will keep the execute permission from the original version of the
file:

<pre>
cp -p ~csci455/assgts/pa3/turninpa3 .
</pre>
