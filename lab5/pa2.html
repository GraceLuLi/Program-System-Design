<a name="intro"><h3>Introduction</h3></a>

In this assignment you will get practice using the Java
<kbd>ArrayList</kbd> class, and more practice implementing your own
classes.  Like you did in assignment 1 and lab 4, you will be
implementing a class whose specification we have given you, in this
case a polynomial class called <kbd>Poly</kbd>; you will also be
writing a command-based program to work with <kbd>Poly</kbd> objects.
Writing the
command-based program will give you more experience processing input
line-by line and error-checking user input.
<p>
Note: this program is due after your midterm exam, but it's a fair
amount bigger than the first assignment.  It will be difficult to
complete it on time if you wait until after the midterm to start it.
It only uses topics from before the midterm, so working on it now will
also help you prepare for the exam (there will be paper and pencil
programming problems as part of the exam).  One possible milestone to
shoot for is to get the Poly class implemented and tested (with
PolyTester) by the midterm.

<a name="files"><h3>The assignment files</h3> 
</a>

<strong>Getting the assignment files.</strong> 
Make a pa2 directory and cd into it.

Copy all of the source code files in the <kbd>pa2</kbd> directory of
the course account to your <kbd>pa2</kbd> directory.  We can
accomplish this with Unix wildcards (denoted with a <kbd>*</kbd>).
The following command copies all files that have a <kbd>.java</kbd>
suffix from the given directory to your current directory:

<pre>cp ~csci455/assgts/pa2/*.java .</pre>
<p>

<p>

The files in <strong><tt>bold</tt></strong></a> below are ones you
 create and/or modify and submit.  The ones not in bold are ones that
 you will use, but not modify.  The files are:

<ul>

<li><a href="Poly.java"><strong><kbd>Poly.java</kbd></strong></a> The
<a href="#interface">interface</a> for the <kbd>Poly</kbd> class; it
contains stub versions of the functions so it will compile.  You will
be completing the <a href="#impl">implementation</a> of this class.
You may not change the interface for this class, but you may add
private instance variables and/or private methods to it

<li><a href="Term.java"><kbd>Term.java</kbd></a> Code for a class for
a single term in a polynomial.  We wrote this class for you.  Don't change it.

<li><strong><kbd>PolyTester.java</kbd></strong> A non-interactive test
program for your <kbd>Poly</kbd> class.  You are not required to
  submit this file.  This is described further in
a <a href="#test">later section</a>.

<li><strong><kbd>PolyProg.java</kbd></strong> The command-based
program that lets you manipulate polynomials.  Its behavior is
specified <a href="#prog">later</a> in the assignment.  You create
this file.

<li><strong><kbd>README</kbd></strong> See
section on <a href="#submit">Submitting your program</a> for what to
put in it.  You create this file.

</ul>

<a name="run"><h3>Note on running your program</h3>

We will be using <kbd>assert</kbd> statements in this program.  To be
able to use them, you need to run the program with asserts enabled
(-ea flag).  (You do not need to compile any special way.)  Here are
two examples:

<pre>
java -ea PolyTester
java -ea PolyProg
</pre>

You should run with this flag set every time.
<p>
Assert statements, described in Section 8.5 of the text, are another
tool to help us write correct code.  More about how we are using them
here in the section on <a href="#invar">implementation invariants</a>.
<p>
NOTE: I have had problems getting assert statements to work in Eclipse
with Java 1.5 (I think I got a compile error); if there is some trick
to doing that that you discover, let us know on the discussion board.
It works fine with javac/java on Unix.
<p>


<a name="assgt"><h3>The assignment</h3>
</a>

You will be implementing a polynomial class along with an interactive
command-based program that uses your class: it will allows the user to
create and manipulate several polynomials.  The internal
representation we will use for a polynomial is an <kbd>ArrayList</kbd>
object.

Some of the requirements for the program relate to efficiency,
testing, and style/design, as well as functionality.  They are described
in detail in the following sections of the document, and then summarized <a
href="#summary">near the end</a> of the document.

<a name="interface"><h3>Poly: interface</h3>

Your polynomial class, <kbd>Poly</kbd>, will have floating point
coefficients, and non-negative integer exponents.  The class
definition is in <a href="Poly.java"><kbd>Poly.java</kbd></a>.  There
is also a helper <kbd>Term</kbd> class defined in <a
href="Term.java"><kbd>Term.java</kbd></a>.  A Term is used to hold the
(coefficient,exponent) pair that makes up one term in a polynomial.
The interface for <kbd>Poly</kbd> is described below using example
calls and results:

<dl>

<dt>
<kbd><strong>Poly p = new Poly();</kbd></strong>
<dd>
Create the zero polynomial.  That is one all of whose coefficients have
the value zero.
<p>

<dt>
<kbd><strong>Poly p = new Poly(new Term(3,5));</kbd></strong>
<dd>
Create a polynomial with a single term.  For example, the above
expression creates the polynomial <kbd>3x<sup>5</sup></kbd>.
<p>

<dt>
<kbd><strong>Poly sum = poly1.add(poly2);</kbd></strong>
<dd>
Add two polynomials, resulting in a new one that is the sum of the first two.
The two original polynomials are unchanged.
<pre>
poly1: 3x<sup>3</sup> + 2.0x + 7
poly2: x<sup>5</sup> -3x<sup>3</sup> + 5
sum:   x<sup>5</sup> + 2x + 12
</pre>
<p>

<dt>
<kbd><strong>double result = poly1.eval(x);</kbd></strong>
<dd>
Evaluate a polynomial for a specific floating point value of x.
<pre>
poly1: 3x<sup>3</sup> + 2x + 7
x: 2
result: 35
</pre>
<p>

<dt>
<kbd><strong>System.out.println(poly1.toFormattedString());</kbd></strong>

<dd> Return a String version of the polynomial that's close to the
usual format we use to denote polynomials.  It's "close to", because
it's not going to use a superscript to denote exponentiation.  Here's
the format to use: <pre>3.0x^2 + 2.0x + 7.0</pre>

For the zero polynomial print <kbd>0.0</kbd>.

Note that to make the coding easier a <kbd>double</kbd> that has no
decimal part is printed as, for example, "3.0" instead of "3"; that's
the default format used in Java when converting such a <kbd>double</kbd> to
a <kbd>String</kbd>.  
</dl>

So, to create polynomials with multiple terms you can use the single-term
or default constructor in combination with <kbd>add</kbd>.  For
example, the statement below builds the polynomial <kbd>5x<sup>3</sup>
+ 2x + 7</kbd>


<pre>
Poly p = new Poly(new Term(5,3)).add(new Poly(new Term(2,1)).add(new Poly(new Term(7,0)); 
</pre>

No <kbd>Poly</kbd> functions should do any I/O.
<p>
Clearly there is additional functionality one might want to offer in a
useful Poly class, such as multiplication, but we'll keep this one
smaller to make it doable within the time constraints.
<p>

You may have noticed that there is one more Poly method,
<kbd>isValidPoly</kbd>, that's <kbd>private</kbd> , i.e., not part of
the public interface.  We will describe that <a href="#invar">later</a>
after we discuss the representation.

<a name="impl"><h3>Poly: representation/implementation</h3>

You can think of a polynomial 
<p>
C<sub>n</sub> x<sup>n</sup> + C<sub>n-1</sub>x<sup>n-1</sup> + . . .+ C<sub>1</sub> x + C<sub>0</sub>
<p>
as a bunch of pairs (C<sub>i</sub>, i), where C<sub>i</sub> is the
coefficient of the term with power i.  We could easily represent this
with an array or ArrayList of n+1 values, where v[i] is the coefficient for
x<sup>i</sup>.  However, for any of the terms where the coefficient is
zero, we don't normally show that as part of the polynomial, since a
zero coefficient makes that whole term zero.  In fact, many times we
have a polynomial with a large degree (highest power of x), but very
few non-zero terms.  We call a polynomial with many zero terms a
<em>sparse</em> polynomial.
<p>
An efficient representation for a sparse polynomial is one where we
only store the non-zero terms.  We're going to use such a sparse
representation using an <kbd>ArrayList</kbd> for it here (a linked
list would also be suitable, but we haven't covered that yet).  Each
element in the list will represent the (C<sub>i</sub>, i) pair for a
non-zero term in the polynomial.  Furthermore, we're going to maintain
this as an <em>ordered</em> list, ordered from highest power term to
lowest.  Here's an example:

<p>
polynomial:   x<sup>100</sup> + 3
<br>
representation: { (1,100) &nbsp;  (3,0) }
<p>
polynomial:   x<sup>2</sup> + 2x + 1
<br>
representation: { (1,2) &nbsp; (2,1) &nbsp (1,0) }
<p>

We can think of the first example above as "1 times x to the 100th plus
3 times x to the 0", which leads to the two pairs given.  The zero
polynomial will be represented by a list of no pairs (i.e., an empty
list).
<p>

The polynomial will be in a simplified form: besides no zero terms, we
won't ever have two terms with the same exponent.  If you look at the
interface for Poly, you will see that there are no restrictions on the
terms to be used in creating one (the term itself has a restriction of
no negative exponents); this implies that the Poly code itself is
responsible for making sure the internal representation is a
simplified polynomial.  The methods that are concerned with this are
the methods that create polynomials: the two constructors and the
<kbd>add</kbd> method.  For example, after executing the following
code sequence all of the poly's <kbd>p1</kbd> through <kbd>p4</kbd> are
the zero polynomial.

<pre>
    Poly p1= new Poly();
    Poly p2 = new Poly(new Term(0, 3));
    Poly p3 = p2.add(new Poly(new Term(0, 7));
    Poly p4 = new Poly(new Term(3, 2)).add(new Poly(new Term(-3, 2));
</pre>

For another example of this simplification, look
at the example input and output for the last call to <kbd>create</kbd>
shown in the section on <a href="#prog" >PolyProg</a>.

<p>
<a name="auxiliary"></a>
<strong>Auxiliary functions.</strong> As usual with classes, you are
free to add private auxiliary (a.k.a., helper) methods that help you
do the work of the methods that are part of the public interface,
especially in cases where you can use that function more than once in
the other code.  This will help you avoid writing redundant code, and
will help you keep your methods shorter and more readable.  See the <a
href="#summary">summary</a> section near the end of the document for
more information about restrictions on method length.
<p>


<a name="add"><h4>More on adding two polynomials</h4>

You are required to add two polynomials in an efficient way.  If the
first polynomial has <em>n</em> non-zero terms, and the second one has
<em>m</em>, you are required to do compute the sum in O(<em>m</em> +
<em>n</em> ) steps.  Since each of the two polynomials' terms are in
order from largest to smallest exponent, we can do this by doing
what's called a "merge" of the two ordered lists.  Note: we will be
talking about big-O notation in class soon: you can think of
O(<em>m</em>+<em>n</em>) as meaning it takes at most
<em>C<sub>1</sub>(m+n) + C<sub>2</sub></em> steps, where
<em>C<sub>1</sub></em> and <em>C<sub>2</sub></em> are constants (i.e.,
the constants don't vary with the size of the lists).
<p>
To merge two ordered lists, traverse them both simultaneously (i.e.,
using one loop; not nested loops).  Compare the current element in
each of the two lists to figure out what value to put at the end of
the result-list next.  When you run out of elements in one of the
lists, just copy all the rest of the elements from the other list into
the result list.
<p>
A merge can be "destructive", which means it reuses elements from the
original lists, or "non-destructive", which means it creates new
elements for the result list.  Since <kbd>add</kbd> is not a mutator
(i.e., the two operands are unchanged by the operation), this is a
non-destructive version.
<p>
Note, however, that <kbd>Term</kbd> objects can be shared between the
operands and the result because the <kbd>Term</kbd> class is immutable
(see section 8.3 of text for more about immutable classes).  Put
another way, you don't always have to do <kbd>new Term(...)</kbd> when
you put a Term into the ArrayList inside a Poly.  Recall that the
<kbd>String</kbd> class is also immutable.
<p>

<a name="invar"><h3>Implementation invariants</h3>

Many of the development techniques we discuss in this class, for
example incremental development, the use of good variable names, and
unit-testing, are to help enable us to write correct code (and make it
easier to enhance that code later).  Another way to ensure correct
code within a class is to make explicit any restrictions on what values
are allowed to be in a private instance variable, and any restrictions on
relationships between values in different instances variables in our object.  Or put another way, making sure we
know what must be true about our object representation when it is in a valid
state.
<p>
Special Topic 8.2 of the textbook discusses class invariants; please
read that section if you haven't already.  The invariants discussed
there are things that are true about the object as viewed by the
client.  Implementation invariants are things that are true about the
object as viewed by the implementor.  Since for many classes, once a
constructor has been called, the other methods can be called in any
order, we need to ensure that none of the constructors or mutators can
leave the object in an invalid state.  It will be easier to do that if
we know what those assumptions are.
n<p>
Note: The Poly class doesn't actually have any mutators, the only
methods that change a poly object's state are the ones that create
them, namely, the two constructors and the <kbd>add</kbd> method.
<p>
There are two assignment requirements for your Poly class related to
this issue (detailed explanations of each of these follow):
<ol>

<li> in a comment next to your private instance variables for Poly,
write down the implementation invariants for the object.  

<li> write the private <kbd>boolean</kbd> method <kbd>isValidPoly()</kbd> and
call it from other places in your program as described below.

</ol>

<strong>The implementation invariant comment for Poly</strong>

<br>

Write a list of all the conditions that the internals of a Poly object
must satisfy.  That is, conditions that are always true about the data
in a valid Poly object.  You can find this information in the <a
 href="#impl">previous section</a>.  For example, one invariant is
that for a non-zero poly all the terms must be in decreasing order by exponent.
<p>
<a name="valid"></a> <strong><kbd>isValidPoly()</kbd>
method</strong>

<br> 

This function will test the implementation invariant for the
internals of a poly.  It will return true iff it is valid, i.e., the
invariants are satisfied.
<p>
Call this function at the end of every Poly method,
including the constructor(s), to make
sure the method leaves the poly
in the correct state.  This is one kind of sanity check: one part of a
program double-checking another part is doing the right thing (similar
to printing expected results and actual results).
<p>

Rather than putting this test in an if statement, we're going to put
it in an <kbd>assert</kbd> statement.  For example:

<pre>
assert isValidPoly();      // calls isValidPoly on implicit parameter
</pre>

  Assert statements are described
in Section 8.5 of the text.
<p>

In addition, for the <kbd>add</kbd> method, call it on the Poly
objects that are the <em>operands</em> of the add as well as the newly created
Poly before returning it.  E.g.,

<pre>
public Poly add(Poly b) {
   . . .
   assert isValidPoly();   // call it on "this"-- the left operand of the add
   assert b.isValidPoly();  // call it on the right operand of the add
   assert result.isValidPoly();    // call it on the poly created in add
   return result;
}
</pre>
The <kbd>add</kbd> operands are supposed to be unmodified by add: the
checks above help make sure you didn't' modify them by mistake.
<p>

Please make sure you are running your program with assertions enabled
for every run of this program, since it's in a development stage.  See
earlier <a href="#run">section</a> for how to do this.

You won't really know if they are getting checked unless you
force one to fail.
<p>
The point of these assert statements is to notify you in no uncertain
terms (so to speak :-)) of possible bugs in your code.  The program
crashing will force you to fix those bugs.  For example, if a Poly
created by <kbd>add</kbd> is not in decreasing order by exponent, then
subsequent uses of that Poly, for example to add it to another Poly,
will not work properly, because the merge algorithm depends on the
ordered property.

<a name="test"><h3>PolyTester program</h3>

<p>

You are required to write a <kbd>PolyTester</kbd> program, similar to
 the other "Tester" programs we have written for other classes, that
 uses hard-coded values to put the methods through their paces on
 well-chosen test cases, and prints expected as well as actual
 results.  You are not required to submit the PolyTester program.
<p>
The main advantage to writing such a program is that it will 
allow you to thoroughly test and debug the more difficult aspects of
your Poly class (in particular, the <kbd>add</kbd> method) without
worrying about the details of doing I/O necessary for the PolyProg.
If you try to debug your PolyProg at the same time as your
Poly class, it will be much harder to pinpoint which part of the
program is causing problems.
<p>
Another advantage to writing a PolyTester program: if you do not get
your PolyProg working, partial credit will be given to a working Poly
class.  You won't even know if you have a working Poly class unless
you have some way to test it.
<p>

<a name="prog"><h3>PolyProg program</h3>

This section describes the user interface for 
<kbd>PolyProg</kbd>, an interactive program that lets you
build and do computations on several Poly objects.
<p>
Your program will initially create an array or ArrayList of 10
polynomials whose initial value is the zero polynomial.  The user will
be able to manipulate any of these polynomials by giving the commands
shown by example below.  The arguments to the commands are indices of
this array.
<p>
Follow the example below to see what the interface should look like.
You should also include an intro message that directs users to a
<kbd>help</kbd> command option, that when given, should provide a command
summary.  You should do some rudimentary error handling as well.  The
example shows some, but not all, of the errors you'll need to handle.
See the next <a href="#error">section</a> for details of error
checking.  User input shown in bold below.  The explanatory text in
italics and parentheses is not part of the actual user interaction.
<p>


<pre>
cmd&gt; <strong>create 0</strong>
Enter a space-separated sequence of coeff-power pairs terminated by &lt;nl&gt;
<strong>1 100 3 0</strong>
cmd&gt; <strong>print 0</strong>

cmd&gt; <strong>create 1</strong>

cmd&gt; <strong>print 1</strong>
64.3 
cmd&gt; <strong>exit</strong>
ERROR: Illegal command.  Type 'help' for command options.
cmd&gt; <strong>quit</strong>
</pre>

Your output for a particular input should match what's shown above
character-by-character (e.g., the messages displayed and the error
handling should be the same), so we can automate our tests when we
grade your program.  There are a few places where we haven't specified
the exact output (the help command, some of the error messages);
obviously, those won't always be the same for each solution.
<p>

<strong>Hint on identifying commands.</strong> The String class has a
method to do case-insensitive comparisons.

<a name="error"><h3>Error checking required</h3>

Here is a list of errors your poly program must check for:  

<ul>
<li> invalid command

<li> illegal polynomial index (for the array of polynomials)

<li> for the polynomial data for the <kbd>create</kbd> command:

  <ul>
    <li>missing the last exponent (i.e., odd number of values).
  For this you should ignore the last value entered (i.e., the term that
  had a coefficient given, but no corresponding exponent).

    <li> negative exponent.  For this you should use the absolute value.

  </ul> 
</ul>

For each one you must print an informative message which also states
the corrective action being taken, if any.  All error messages must
start with the string "ERROR:".  For the last two items listed above,
where you are taking corrective action, you should label your message
with the string "WARNING:" instead.

<a name="lineinput"><h3>Reading polynomial data for <kbd>create</kbd>
command</h3>

The polynomial data for the <kbd>create</kbd> command are free-form.
Here is more about what <em>will</em> be allowed in that line of
input:

<ul>
<li> Zero coefficients.  A polynomial created with a term with a zero
coefficient is fine.  The Poly class itself handles simplifying the
polynomial.  There was an example shown of this in the last 
<kbd>create</kbd> command given in the large
example shown <a href="#prog">earlier</a>.

<li> Multiple coefficients that have the same exponent.  Since you
will be creating a polynomial for each term entered, the
<kbd>add</kbd> operator will take care of correctly combining these
polynomials with the same exponent.  The <kbd>create</kbd>
example just mentioned also shows this.

<li> Multiple spaces (' ') and/or tabs ('\t') are allowed before,
between or after the numbers given.  Recall that the first newline
('\n') encountered terminates the list of numbers.

</ul>

</strong>  Completing this last requirement of <kbd>create</kbd> is a
little tricky since "in.nextInt()", for example, skips leading
whitespace <em>including newlines</em>, but we are using newline as
our sentinel, so we have to be able to test for it.
<p>
Section 11.2.2 of the textbook (called Processing Lines) shows two
ways to solve the problem of processing an indeterminate number of
values all on one line.  The second one of these will probably be
easier here.  It takes advantage of the fact that the
<kbd>Scanner</kbd> class can also be used to read from a
<kbd>String</kbd> instead of the keyboard.  First you use
<kbd>nextLine()</kbd> to read the whole line into a String.  Then you
use a <em>second</em> <kbd>Scanner</kbd> object initialized with this
string to then break up the line into the parts you want, using the
Scanner methods you are already familiar with.
<p>
Hint on how to test out this technique: write a little test program to
read an indeterminate number of ints from each line.  For each line
break it up into an indeterminate number of ints, storing them in an
ArrayList.  Note: This simpler test is not exactly the code you will need for
this program (for example, reading the create input involves reading a double
alternated with an int).
<p>

<a name="struct"><h3>Structure of <kbd>PolyProg</kbd></h3>

The code for <kbd>PolyProg</kbd> is much too complicated to put it all
into one <kbd>main</kbd> method.  We could design and add another
class, to encapsulate the collection of polynomials, but that still
would leave all the code to do the I/O.  The structure of such a
command-based program lends itself more to a procedural programming
design, which we'll review below.
<p>
A good design principle is to keep each of your functions small, for
easier program readability.  In object-oriented programming, the class
design sometimes naturally results in small methods, but sometimes you
still need auxiliary private methods as we discussed in a <a
href="#auxiliary">previous section</a>.  The same principles apply for
a procedural design.  Since we haven't given you a predefined method
decomposition for the PolyProg, you will have to create this
decomposition yourself (although we'll give you some hints, coming
up).
<p>

A procedural design in Java is just implemented as <kbd>static</kbd>
methods in Java that pass data around via explicit parameters.  Static
methods are discussed in Section 8.6 of the text.  We have seen
several examples of this in other test programs we have written, for
example <a
href="../../labs/lab4/NumsTester.java"><kbd>NumsTester.java</kbd></a>
of lab4 and 
<kbd>PartialNamesTester.java</kbd>
we developed in lecture.  We have also seen some utility classes in
Java that have static methods: <kbd>Math</kbd> and <kbd>Arrays</kbd>.

<p>
In particular here, for <em>each</em> PolyProg command you may want a
function to read the data for it and process it once you identify
which command it is.  E.g., <kbd>doEval</kbd>, <kbd>doCreate</kbd>,
etc.  That way it will be easy to see the main control structure of
<kbd>main</kbd>, because it won't be cluttered with a lot of code for
reading command arguments, for example.  Some of those "do" functions
will need to be further decomposed into smaller steps (almost certainly
doCreate will).
<p>
Note: the next section discusses a limit on method length as one of
our style guidelines for this course.
<p>


<a name="summary"><h3>Summary of requirements</h3>

As on the first assignment, there are several requirements for this
assignment related to design, testing, and development process strewn
throughout this document.  We'll summarize those and the functional
requirements here:

<ul>

<li> implement Poly class according it's public interface (see <a
href="#interface">Poly: interface</a>)

<li> use the representation for Poly described in the
section <a href="#impl">about that</a>.

<li> the <kbd>Poly add</kbd> method can't run in more than O(m+n) time as
described in the section on <a href="#add">adding two polynomials</a>.

<li> write <a href="#invar">implementation invariant</a> comments for
Poly class.

<li> implement and use private Poly method <kbd>isValidPoly</kbd> as described 
<a href="#valid">here</a>.

<li> implement PolyProg with the user interface described in section
about the <a href="#prog">Poly program</a>.

<li> this program will also be evaluated on style and documentation.
We will deduct points for programs that do not follow the published <a
 href="../style.html" >style guidelines</a> for this course (they are
also linked from the Assignments page).  (Note: For pa1 we only
deducted points for problems related to <em>some</em> of the style
guidelines.)  One guideline we want you to be especially aware of is the limit of 30
lines of code at most allowable in a method.  This is exclusive of
whitespace, comment lines, and lines that just have a curly bracket by
itself (i.e., you should not sacrifice code-readability to make your
code fit into this limit).

</ul>


<a name="submit"><h3>README file / Submitting your program</h3>

You will be submitting <kbd>Poly.java</kbd>, <kbd>PolyProg.java</kbd>, and
<kbd>README</kbd>.  Make sure your name and loginid appear at the
start of each file.
<p>
Here's a review of what goes in the README:  This is the place to
document known bugs in your program. That means you should describe
thoroughly any test cases that fail for the the program you are
submitting.  You can also use the README to give the grader any other
special information, such as if there is some special way to compile
or run your program.
<p>
Like last time, for your convenience we put the exact submit command
to use in a shell script.  This time we made the script executable, so
you do not have to "source" it, but can run it directly from the
shell.  Type:

<pre>
~csci455/assgts/pa2/turninpa2
</pre>

to submit the program.  (It's just a text file, so you can look at
its <a href="turninpa2">contents</a> to see the submit command it will run.)
